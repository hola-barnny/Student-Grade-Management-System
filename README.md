# UNILAG Physiology Student Grade Management System

This is a Python-based program to manage and calculate grades for third-year Physiology students at the University of Lagos for their second semester courses.

## Features
- **Register students, their courses and initialize their grades.**
- **Add or update grades for each course.**
- **Calculate and display average grades for each course.**
- **Retrieve the highest and lowest scores in each course.**
- **Display all student grades.**

## Project Setup

2. Run `main_manager.py` to manage the grades and view results.

## Course Information
- Courses include: Gross Anatomy III, Neuroanatomy, Nutritional Biochemistry, Practical in Biochemistry, General Pharmacology, Neurophysiology I, Special Senses, Skin and Body Temperature Regulation, Research Methodology, Laboratory Teaching, and Instrumentation.

## Development Environment
This project was developed in PyCharm and VS Code, an integrated development environment (IDE) that is particularly well-suited for Python programming. PyCharm and VS Code provided a number of features that were essential in managing and debugging the code for the Student Grade Management System.
## Contribution
Each team member is expected to modularize their contributions, commit, and document changes clearly.
